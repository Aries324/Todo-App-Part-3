# Assessment: Todos Part 1

For this assessment, you'll be extending a todo application such that users can actually interact with it.

Here's what the final product should look like:

In doing so, you'll be demonstrating a basic understanding of the following:

- modifying component-specific values using state
- responding to user interactions by using event handlers and component methods

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Can Add a Todo:

When a user types into the top input and hits the Enter/return key, it should add it as a todo and empty the input.

### User can mark a todo as complete:

When a user clicks on the circle at the beginning of a todo it will toggle whether that todo is completed or not.

### User Can Delete a Todo:

When a user clicks the "X" on the right of a Todo, it removes it from the list.

### User Can Delete all Todos Marked as Complete:

When a user clicks the button 'Clear Completed' it will delete all todos that are marked as complete.

## Submission

You **will** be required to submit a deployed application. If you instead
submit a link to a repository (that is, only code), you _will_ be awarded
**0** points.
