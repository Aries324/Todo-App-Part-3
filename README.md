# Assessment: Todos, Part II

Previously, you wrote an application tha displayed a list of todos. For this assessment,
you'll be extending that todo application such that users can actually interact with it.

_Once again, part 1 was purely visual and no functionality. Part 2 will be focused on adding functionality_

Here's the finally product again as a reminder of what the complete product
will look like:

In doing so, you'll be demonstrating a basic understanding of the following:

- modifying component-specific values using state
- responding to user interactions by using event handlers and component methods


## Getting Started
To get started, copy your code from part 1 into a new repository.


## Acceptance Criteria

### Step 1: { Task description } (x point(s))
{ Describe the task to be completed }


## Bonus (0 points)

If you find yourself with extra time (e.g., don't have other assessments to
catch up on), you may consider improving the quality in a number of ways:

- { some extra work that can be done to challenge the student further }

## Submission

This morning, you learned how to deploy a React app to GitHub Pages, so you
__will__ be required to submit a deployed application today. If you instead
submit a link to a GitHub repository (that is, only code), you _will_ be awarded
__0__ points.
